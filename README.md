Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Week 4 - Course Project

This repository contains following files:

- R code "run_analysis.R": R analysis code in order to create the tidy data set as described in the task for the course project
- documentation files: "CodeBook.md" describes the variables that were used in the analysis 
and this README.md file

Following data were used as the basis for the analysis:

==================================================================
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0
==================================================================

Following steps were performed in the data analysis:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
